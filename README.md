# Show Me My Schedule

Welcome to my application! This is a simple daily planner that uses third party APIs, such as Bootstrap, JQuery, and Moment.js. Simply type in your task with its coorresponding hour block and click save. The time blocks are color coded to demonstrate if that time block is in the past, present, or future, depending on what time of day the user is checking the application. The time at the time is dynamic and will update every minute. 

Yellow = Time block has passed, your task is late!

Red = Current time block

Green = Time blocks yet to occur

Have fun staying organized!
